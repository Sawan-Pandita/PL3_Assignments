00:00:17,112 --> 00:00:24,811
We took it all apart but I
am wishing I had stayed

2
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:32,418
In the back room something
I heard you say

3
00:00:32,616 --> 00:00:36,615
We didn′t wanna call it too early

4
00:00:36,807 --> 00:00:40,806
Now it seems a world away
but I miss that day

5
00:00:41,002 --> 00:00:45,801
Are we ever gona feel the same?

6
00:00:46,009 --> 00:00:50,208
Standing in the light till It
is over‚ out of our minds

7
00:00:50,410 --> 00:00:53,409
Someone had to draw a line

8
00:00:53,601 --> 00:00:56,700
We′ll be coming back for you one day

9
00:00:56,918 --> 00:01:00,517
We′ll be coming back for you one day

10
00:01:00,709 --> 00:01:05,508
I don′t even care if I know
you‚ out of our minds

11
00:01:05,702 --> 00:01:08,001
Sad to leave it all behind

12
00:01:08,217 --> 00:01:13,916
We′ll be coming back

13
00:01:14,114 --> 00:01:22,113
We′ll be coming back for you one day

14
00:01:51,215 --> 00:01:57,714
You can see it from afar‚ we
were riding that wave

15
00:01:57,906 --> 00:02:05,905
Blinded by the lights‚ and
It is something I crave

16
00:02:06,409 --> 00:02:09,808
We didn′t want to call it too early

17
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,199
Now it seems a world away
but I miss that day

18
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:19,500
Are we ever gona feel the same?

19
00:02:19,714 --> 00:02:23,913
Standing in the light till It
is over‚ out of our minds

20
00:02:24,115 --> 00:02:26,714
Someone had to draw a line

21
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:30,509
We′ll be coming back for you one day

22
00:02:30,701 --> 00:02:34,300
We′ll be coming back for you one day

23
00:02:34,504 --> 00:02:38,903
I don′t even care if I know
you‚ out of our minds

24
00:02:39,111 --> 00:02:41,710
Sad to leave it all behind

25
00:02:41,916 --> 00:02:45,415
We′ll be coming back for you one day

26
00:02:45,613 --> 00:02:53,612
We′ll be coming back for you one day

27
00:02:57,912 --> 00:03:01,011
Gona rise‚ gona fall‚ getting
pulled apart

28
00:03:01,205 --> 00:03:04,704
And we all do it all cause
it stole our hearts

29
00:03:04,918 --> 00:03:08,417
Gona light up the skies‚
so ignore the stars

30
00:03:08,613 --> 00:03:16,612
And we all do it all cause
it stole our hearts

31
00:03:19,806 --> 00:03:23,805
Standing in the light till It
is over‚ out of our minds

32
00:03:24,005 --> 00:03:26,704
Someone had to draw a line

We′ll be coming back for you one day

35
00:03:34,404 --> 00:03:38,903
I don′t even care if I know
